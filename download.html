	<h3>How to Download an Episode from the Website?</h3>
	<p>Depending on the browser you're using, it may be very simple to download or more complex. On certain browsers you will see an option menu on the audio player that will allow you to download the audio file. However if you are not able to find such option, here are the steps you can take to download: </p>
	<ul>
		<li>Go on the page that has the audio file you want. Right click on the backgound and click select view source code</li>
		<li>You will see the audio files that end with .mp3. If you are not able to spot them, you can use Ctrl + F to find ".mp3"</li>
		<li>Find your audio file, right click the hyperlink and click save as</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>How to Download in a higher quality?</h3>
	<p>If for some reason you want to download in a higher quality (because the audio files had to be compressed a ton in order to put them online), you can download the audio from the YouTube videos. Use your favourite YouTube downloader (I use YouTube-dl) and download the audio track of the episode you want.</p>
	<h3>How to Download a Video?</h3>
	<p>If for some odd reason you want to download a video of an episode, you can use your favourite YouTube downloader (I use YouTube-dl).</p>
	<h3>Why does the website always break</h3>
	<p>Like seriously why is that the bottom of the page look like crap AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA</p>
	<p>EDIT: I fixed it :D</p>
