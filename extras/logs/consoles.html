		<h1>Consoles Repair Logs</h1>

		<p>
			Welcome to the Consoles Repair Logs! This is the place where I will document my experience repairing video game consoles.<br><br>
			I recently acquired 4 Nintendo DS's where 3 has some kind of damage.

		<p>Every system is able to read both DS and GameBoy Advance games. The grey one, however, will eat your DS cartridge (force is needed to pull the cartridge out of the slot after ejection). The pink system seem to be in perfect working condition. The Mijumaru system has a damaged top screen and a scratched up bottom screen. I think the scratched part is the screen protector. I will remove it and see how it looks under it. The grey one has a damaged top screen and no audio, and the turquoise one has a broken hinge and very yellow displays (especially the top one).<br><br>I am hoping that a some of the display issues are caused by a bad connection, as it would be an easy fix. Otherwise I would have to order replacement screens. The Mijumaru system will definitively need a replacement screen if I want to get rid of the dark spot.<br><br>Cosmetically speaking, there are a lot of issues too, but I won't worry about that for the moment.</p>
		<p>Fun fact: Due to the fact that I did not own a charger for the original DS, I used an universal battery charger (for mobile phones, I think) to charge the battery. It worked! I'm not sure if I can recommend you doing the same though. Do this at your own risk.</p>
