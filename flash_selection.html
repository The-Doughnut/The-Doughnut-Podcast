	<h2><a id="announcement">FLASH OF THE WEEK: Ultimate Flash Sonic</a></h2>
	<p>Ultimate Flash Sonic is a fan made Sonic game that got really popular in the 2000's and even in the early 2010's. I remember playing this specific game back in primary school in the computer lab. Fun times. Check out the <a href="https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/151706">Newgrounds submission.</a>.</p>

	<h3>The Shockwave Experience</h3>
	<p>Remember Shockwave? Shockwave was another technology which existed alongside with Flash Player. In order to play the following games, you will have to use a Shockwave enabled browser. At this time, the only browser which supports the Shockwave plugin is Internet Explorer. If you must use another browser, you will have to install an older version of it (if security risks are no concern).<br>If Shockwave is not installed yet, you may still install it on <a href="https://www.adobe.com/products/shockwaveplayer/shwv_distribution3.html">Adobe's website</a> somehow, even after its end of life, which is quite strange. But you might as well enjoy it whilst it lasts.</p>

	<h3>The World of Java</h3>
	<p>Once upon a time, Java Applets were common on the web. These days, not so much. How about we take a look at a few applets? <br>In order to run Java Applets, you will have to make sure that you have Java installed and that you are using Internet Explorer. I personally had difficulties with Internet Explorer 11. Internet Explorer 8 worked, but this site is not compatible with IE 8, so I'm assuming either IE 9 ot IE 10 will work. You may also try an older version of Firefox or Chrome which supports Java (if security risks are no concern).</p>
