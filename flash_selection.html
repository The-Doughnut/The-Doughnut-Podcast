	<h2><a id="announcement">FLASH OF THE WEEK: Gravity Guy</a></h2>
	<p>
		Sorry guys, it has been so long since I updated the Flash of the week. I have been really busy with school and procrastination and I totally forgot about this whole thing!<br><br>
		Anyways, let me introduce you to Gravity Guy. This game was on Miniclip in the early 2010's and it was one of the most popular games we played back then. There was even an iOS and Android release. I don't actually remember if I downloaded it back in the day, and I can't check if I did because I lost my old iPod Touch. I'm sure I played it though, if I didn't play on my iPod, it was probably on a friend's iPod.<br><br>
		In this game, you are running away from a person (I still don't know who it is), and by doing so you will have to jump from platform to platform whilst avoiding obstacles and falling into the void.<br><br>
		I am unable to provide you a link for the source because the game has been removed from Miniclip.

	<h3>Flash, but not games</h3>
	<p>Many people remember Flash because of Flash games and Flash movies. But we must remember that Flash was not only made for those types of content. Flash was made for any kind of interactivity on a web page. Below, you can view a museum of interactive Flash content from around the web.<br><br>

	<h3>The Shockwave Experience</h3>
	<p>Remember Shockwave? Shockwave was another technology which existed alongside with Flash Player. In order to play the following games, you will have to use a Shockwave enabled browser. At this time, the only browser which supports the Shockwave plugin is Internet Explorer. If you must use another browser, you will have to install an older version of it (if security risks are no concern).<br>If Shockwave is not installed yet, you may still install it on <a href="https://www.adobe.com/products/shockwaveplayer/shwv_distribution3.html">Adobe's website</a> somehow, even after its end of life, which is quite strange. But you might as well enjoy it whilst it lasts.</p>

	<h3>The World of Java</h3>
	<p>Once upon a time, Java Applets were common on the web. These days, not so much. How about we take a look at a few applets? <br>In order to run Java Applets, you will have to make sure that you have Java installed and that you are using Internet Explorer. I personally had difficulties with Internet Explorer 11. Internet Explorer 8 worked, but this site is not compatible with IE 8, so I'm assuming either IE 9 ot IE 10 will work. You may also try an older version of Firefox or Chrome which supports Java (if security risks are no concern).</p>
