	<h3>FFX Runner</h3>
	<p>What do you think when you hear "Miniclip"? To me, it reminds me of monster truck games, Gravity Guy, a 3D Taxi game I used to play which I cannot find anymore, Bloxorz, Dune Buggy, that one game where you shoot cannons at enemies at the beach, and of course, FFX Runner (also called On The Run). To be honest, as a kid I did not understand the goal of the game. I thought that I had to survive as long as possible before getting destroyed by the bad guys, but actually you had to drive to the finish line.<br><br>I would like to link you to the Miniclip page, but unfortunately the game is no longer available on there.</p>
