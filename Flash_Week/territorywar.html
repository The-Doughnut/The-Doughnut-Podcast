	<h3>Territory War</h3>
	<p>Territory war was a great game. I had the most fun playing local multipayer with friends, but playing against the computer opponent is also quite fun (especially when they shoot their own teammate). Check out the game on <a href="http://afro-ninja.com/game/31">Afro-Ninja's page</a> or on <a href="https://armorgames.com/play/279/territory-war">Armor Games</a>.</p>
