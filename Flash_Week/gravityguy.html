	<h3>Gravity Guy</h3>
	<p>
		Sorry guys, it has been so long since I updated the Flash of the week. I have been really busy with school and procrastination and I totally forgot about this whole thing!<br><br>
		Anyways, let me introduce you to Gravity Guy. This game was on Miniclip in the early 2010's and it was one of the most popular games we played back then. There was even an iOS and Android release. I don't actually remember if I downloaded it back in the day, and I can't check if I did because I lost my old iPod Touch. I'm sure I played it though, if I didn't play on my iPod, it was probably on a friend's iPod.<br><br>
		In this game, you are running away from a person (I still don't know who it is), and by doing so you will have to jump from platform to platform whilst avoiding obstacles and falling into the void.<br><br>
		I am unable to provide you a link for the source because the game has been removed from Miniclip.
