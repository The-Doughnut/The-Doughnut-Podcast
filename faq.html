	<h3>FAQ</h3>
	<p>
		<b>Why is there a Flash section?</b><br><br>
		I decided to include a Flash section during the last moments of Flash Player to remember the good times we had with Flash games and Flash movies. If your Flash is on this website and you want it removed, please contact me on either <a href="https://whaaat002.newgrounds.com/">Newgrounds</a> (send me a PM) or on Discord (server link is on the main page).
